1. **Optimal Control**
 - example for DP
 - shortest paths
 - Have you got policy and value iteration
 - LQR Ricatti solver (CURRENT)
 - Kalman Filter
2. **Continuous Time Control**
 - add things from notes
 - add Milstein to Euler Maruyama
 - HJB solver
3. **Stochastic Approximation and Function Approximation**
4. **Bandits**
 - Gradient Bandit
-  Contextual Bandits
 - Need to define non-Bernoulli Bandits
5. **RL** 
 - expected SARSA.
 - Cross Entropy Method.
