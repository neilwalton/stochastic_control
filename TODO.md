1. **Optimal Control**
 - example for DP
 - shortest paths
 - Have you got policy and value iteration
 - Kalman Filter
2. **Continuous Time Control**
 - add things from notes
 - HJB solver
3. **Stochastic Approximation and Function Approximation**
4. **Bandits**
 - Gradient Bandit
 - Need to define non-Bernoulli Bandits
5. **RL** 
 - Q-learning example finish 
 - SARSA and maybe expected SARSA.
 - Cross Entropy Method.
