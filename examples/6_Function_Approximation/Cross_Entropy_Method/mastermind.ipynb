    "Mastermind is the following game:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *There are 7 colours to choose from. 4 colored pegs are chosen and placed 4 slots in order. This is hidden from the player.  The player places combinations of 4. As feedback the player recieves the number of correct colors and, amoung the remaining pegs, the number of correct colours in the incorrect place. The player wins when the correct 4 colours are placed in the correct order.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The book of \"The Cross-Entropy Method\" by Rubenstien and Kroese discusses Mastermind  using the Cross-Entropy Method as a solution method. Here it is not obvious how to approach the problem as a dynamic program (with a reasonable state space), in this sense it is a valid alternative to a DP approach. Also it is much computationally faster than exhaustive approaches. These find a solution with far fewer guesses but do not scale well as we increaase the number of colors and slots. This highlights the advantages of the approach as a heuristic. Nonetheless there are straightforward solutions for this problem that do better than the cross entropy method. "
